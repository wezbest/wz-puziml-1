Blimey, guvna, listen up, I've got a tale,
About nuclear fusion, it's the energy trail,
See, it's like bashin' atoms together, a right old squeeze,
Makin' 'em merge, releasin' energy with expertise.

It's the sun's trick, innit, how it shines so bright,
Fusin' hydrogen into helium, day and night,
Releasin' heat and light, it's a right old bash,
The energy's clean, no mess, no nuclear rash.

Imagine takin' two isotopes, deuterium and tritium too,
Heatin' 'em up, makin' 'em fuse, it's what we're gonna do,
In a reactor, a special device, we'll make it all happen,
Makin' electricity, no pollution, no need to be snappin'.

It's the future, innit, the way we'll go,
Clean energy, no more fossil fuels, don't you know,
So let's get crackin', make it all real,
Nuclear fusion, it's the way we'll all feel.

Now, I know what you're thinkin', "Is it safe, mate?"
The answer's yes, it's the way we'll participate,
In a cleaner world, with energy to spare,
Nuclear fusion, it's the way we'll show we care.

So there you have it, a rhyming tale,
About nuclear fusion, it's the energy trail,
It's the future, innit, the way we'll go,
Clean energy, no more fossil fuels, don't you know!
