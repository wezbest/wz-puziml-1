Blimey, guvna, listen up, I've got a tale,
About nuclear fusion, it's off the scale!
It's the process, innit, where atoms combine,
Releasin' energy, like a right old shine.

Imagine takin' two tiny particles, like mates,
And smashin' 'em together, it's a right old state,
They fuse into one, like a happy couple, yeah?
Releasin' heat and light, like a bloomin' bubble.

It's the same process, ain't it, that powers the sun,
Makes it shine so bright, like a right old bun,
And scientists, they're tryin' to replicate,
This fusion reaction, it's a right old participate.

They're buildin' reactors, like big machines, yeah?
To harness the energy, like a right old dream,
It's clean and green, like a fresh new leaf,
No more pollution, like a right old relief.

So there you have it, nuclear fusion in rhyme,
It's the future of energy, and it's lookin' just fine,
It's a right old knees-up, for the planet, innit?
Nuclear fusion, it's the way to win it!
