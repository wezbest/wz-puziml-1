Gentle blooms aroma wilt,

In quiet elegance lie

Goddesses among flowers.

This Haiku attempts to symbolize women with the essence and beauty of various flowers. While it can have different interpretations, I see it capturing the gracefulness and mysterious fragrance a woman may represent, while hinting at our natural ties and similarities between women and natural flora, often likened to 'flowers.' Again, I feel it is the beauty in nuance, appreciation, and acceptance that shines through a successful Haiku poem.
